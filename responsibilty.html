            We support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions by 2050.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past 25 years, impactinvestment.com has built one of the largest private renewable power businesses in
            the world. With installed renewable generating capacity of 20 GW, we now produce more than enough green
            energy to power London and will more than double that amount once our development portfolio is brought
            online.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recognize that further renewable power capacity must be rapidly scaled to replace fossil fuel generation
            and meet expanding global electricity demand so that the world can eliminate the over 70% of global
            emissions that come from final energy consumption as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            impactinvestment.com intends to build on this leading position in renewable power and do much more to
            contribute to the transition to net zero:

            Integrating ESG considerations into our investment process
        </h1>

        <p>
            Our commitments include incorporating ESG factors into our investment decisions, starting with the due
            diligence of potential investments through to the exit process. We tailor ESG due diligence to each
            investment, and we create post-investment remediation plans for material ESG considerations. For all
            potential investments, we use internal experts and a variety of ESG frameworks to identify material ESG
            factors and utilize external consultants where appropriate. This analysis includes everything from ensuring
            environmental, legal and regulatory compliance to the identification of opportunities to add value or
            mitigate risk in our portfolio. Our investment teams use an ESG due diligence guideline to ensure
            consideration of material ESG risks and opportunities. These teams then provide a detailed memorandum to the
            Investment Committee outlining the merits of the transaction and disclosures relating to risks, including
            material ESG issues, and potential mitigation strategies. All investments made by impactinvestment.com must be
            approved by the Investment Committee and must incorporate ESG matters into their evaluation, including
            anti-bribery and corruption, health and safety, and other ESG considerations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon company acquisition, we create a tailored integration plan to ensure that all material matters,
            including ESG risks and opportunities are prioritized. ESG risks and opportunities are actively managed by
            the portfolio companies with guidance from our in-house investment teams, primarily through representation
            on company boards and equivalent oversight bodies where all financial, operational, and strategic elements
            of the business are reported, considered, and where appropriate, approved. This allows us to draw on local
            expertise, which provides valuable insight given the wide range of asset types and locations in which we
            invest. Certain key performance indicators, such as serious safety incidents, are reported regularly to the
            applicable board or other oversight body.

                    A STRONG GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We are always working to maintain sound governance practices to ensure ongoing investor confidence.
                    This involves a continual review of how evolving legislation, guidelines and best practices should
                    be reflected in our approach. For example, we have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, including
                    facilitation payments, and all impactinvestment.com employees are mandated to complete an in-depth
                    anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) training seminar annually. impactinvestment.com maintains an ethics
                    hotline to report suspected unethical, illegal or unsafe behavior. Our reporting hotline is managed
                    by an independent third party and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We also require all
                    portfolio companies in which we have a controlling interest to adopt an ABC policy that is equally
                    stringent to impactinvestment.com’s, which entails that portfolio companies install an ethics hotline
                    within six months of acquisition.
